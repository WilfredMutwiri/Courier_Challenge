# ðŸšš Courier Services Mock Challenge

Welcome to the **Courier Services Mock Challenge Project**, a modern web-based logistics platform that simulates a parcel delivery and pickup system using a decentralized network of vetted agents. Built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Flowbite-React, this app is ideal for demonstrating logistics-tech features in a clean and user-friendly interface.
